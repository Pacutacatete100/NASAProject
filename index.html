        <p style="color: white;">Most americans think that NASA's yearly budget is 20% of the US' national budget, so its no wonder why most americans think their budget should be reduced</p>
        <p style="color: white;"> The actual budget of NASA is 4% of the United States yearly budget. That means that if the US's national budget was 100 dollars, Nasa would get around 40 cents.</p>
        <p style="color: white;">This website is dedicated to show you what incredible things we get in return for those 40 cents. Click on each tab to listen to the 5 different reasons</p>
